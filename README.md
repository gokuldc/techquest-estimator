# 🛸 OPENPRIX
**The Operating System for Modern Engineering & Construction Firms.**
OPENPRIX is a high-performance project management ecosystem built for engineering firms that need local speed with network flexibility. It bridges the gap between a robust Electron Desktop App and a Localized Web Server, allowing teams to sync tasks, logs, and communications across an office network without relying on slow, expensive cloud subscriptions.
## 💎 The Ghost Architecture
OPENPRIX is designed around a **Local-First** philosophy. Data lives in a high-speed SQLite engine on your host machine, while an integrated Express server provides real-time access to mobile devices and browsers on the same network.
## 🛠 Core Modules
 * **⚡ Operations Interface:**
   * **Hot-Editable Logs:** Excel-like efficiency. Edit daily work logs, serial numbers, and statuses directly in the grid with auto-save triggers.
   * **Intelligent Filtering:** Instantly pivot data by month, staff, or project code.
 * **📋 Global Kanban Engine:**
   * **Aggregated Tasks:** Automatically pulls ganttTasks from every active project into one master board.
   * **Native Drag & Drop:** Move tasks across lanes (Backlog, Procurement, Progress, QC, Done) with instant database synchronization.
 * **💬 Commlink (Channels):**
   * **Threaded Conversations:** WhatsApp-style inline replies and nested threads using replyToId logic.
   * **Rich Mentions:** Discord-style @username popups to notify specific personnel.
 * **📊 Market Analytics (LMR):**
   * **Labor-Material-Resource Database:** Manage regional price sheets with high-speed "Ghost" inputs.
   * **Inflation Tracking:** Real-time trend visualization using Recharts to monitor price fluctuations over time.
## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
 * Node.js (LTS recommended)
 * npm or yarn
### Deployment

### 🔑 Default Credentials
Upon first launch, use the following credentials to access the administrative dashboard:
> **Username:** admin
> **Password:** admin123
> 
**Note:** For security, please navigate to the User Management settings and update your password immediately after your first successful login.
## 🌐 Network Server Mode
To allow other engineers on your local Wi-Fi/LAN to access the dashboard:
 1. Open the **Server Manager** inside the app.
 2. Assign a **Port** (Default: 3000).
 3. Click **Start Server**.
 4. Other users can navigate to http://[Your-IP]:3000 to access the Web Bridge.
## 🛡 Security
 * **Preload Isolation:** Core database commands are never exposed to the frontend; they are mediated through a secure IPC bridge.
 * **Clearance Levels:** Integrated RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with five levels of administrative clearance.
